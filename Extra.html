												<h3>Web Development</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This website is also one of my projects. I used a website template and customized it accordingly using HTML and CSS. It is an application of basic web design and development knowledge.</p>

												<h3>Full Scholarship</h3>
											</header>
											<p>I had a passion for sports at a young age. I tried tennis, basketball, volleyball, table tennis and badminton. I pursued a badminton career by self-training and joining tournaments. 
											<br>
											<br>I applied to Mapua University and got accepted. I received a full athletic scholarship in Badminton during my collegiate years. Not everyone received a full scholarship but I was one of the best in my team. </p>

												<h3>Student Athlete</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Mapua is one of the only schools in the Philippines that have 4 semesters (Quarterm) per year, creating a hectic schedule for a student athlete. 
											<br>
											<br>There was a daily training schedule at 7am and an absent period of 2 weeks for the NCAA. Time management was crucial for my survival.</p>

												<h3>Team captain</h3>
											</header>
											<p> I was team captain of the Men's Badminton team during 2021-2022. I was appointed team captain, not as the best player but the player who brings the most value to the team and leads by example. 
											
											
											<br><br>I learned how to manage and inspire people effectively. The experience had embedded multiple life lessons and established meaningful relationships.</p>
